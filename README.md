An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart; it contains rich pathological information on cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmia. However, it is difficult to visually analyze ECG signals due to their complexity and nonlinearity. We use the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database to develop machine learning methods for ECG beat classification. The MIT-BIH database contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. We plan to first do some data preprocessing to transform the ECG records to single heartbeats. Then split training and testing data. Finally, we train several models, KNN, SVM, decision tree and random forest, to classify the heartbeats using training data and then compare the models on the testing data.
